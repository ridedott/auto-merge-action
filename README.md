Automatically merge Pull Requests created from a GitHub account.

## Usage

The action supports three scenarios:

- Where GitHub Actions are used exclusively.
- Where a third party CI system provider is used.
- Where both GitHub Actions and a third party CI system provider are used.

Depending on the scenario, different configuration is required, as described
below.

### GitHub Actions

When a repository uses GitHub Actions exclusively, Merge Me! action should be
added as a last job in the CI workflow.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/continuous-integration.yaml

jobs:
  # Other jobs are defined above.
  merge-me:
    name: Merge me!
    needs:
      - all
      - other
      - required
      - jobs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Merge me!
        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@master
        with:
          # Depending on branch protection rules, a  manually populated
          # `GITHUB_TOKEN_WORKAROUND` environment variable with permissions to
          # push to a protected branch must be used. This variable can have an
          # arbitrary name, as an example, this repository uses
          # `GITHUB_TOKEN_DOTTBOTT`.
          #
          # When using a custom token, it is recommended to leave the following
          # comment for other developers to be aware of the reasoning behind it:
          #
          # This must be used as GitHub Actions token does not support
          # pushing to protected branches.
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Third party CI systems

When a repository uses third party CI systems, Merge Me! action should be added
as a stand-alone workflow, which is triggered by changes to checks and pull
requests.

Create a new `.github/workflows/merge-me.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: Merge me!

on:
  check_suite:
    types:
      - completed
  pull_request:
    types:
      - edited
      - labeled
      - opened
      - ready_for_review
      - reopened
      - synchronize
      - unlabeled
      - unlocked

jobs:
  merge-me:
    name: Merge me!
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Merge me!
        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@master
        with:
          # Depending on branch protection rules, a  manually populated
          # `GITHUB_TOKEN_WORKAROUND` environment variable with permissions to
          # push to a protected branch must be used. This variable can have an
          # arbitrary name, as an example, this repository uses
          # `GITHUB_TOKEN_DOTTBOTT`.
          #
          # When using a custom token, it is recommended to leave the following
          # comment for other developers to be aware of the reasoning behind it:
          #
          # This must be used as GitHub Actions token does not support
          # pushing to protected branches.
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### GitHub Actions and third party CI systems

When GitHub Actions and used in combination with third party CI systems, both of
the configurations described above should be applied.

## Configuration

### Enable auto-merge for a different bot

You may have another bot that also creates PRs against your repository and you
want to automatically merge those. By default, this GitHub Action assumes the
bot is [`dependabot`](https://dependabot.com/). You can override the bot name by
changing the value of `GITHUB_LOGIN` parameter:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Merge me!
    uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@master
    with:
      GITHUB_LOGIN: my-awesome-bot-r2d2
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Use of configurable pull request merge method

By default, this GitHub Action assumes merge method is `SQUASH`. You can
override the merge method by changing the value of `MERGE_METHOD` parameter (one
of `MERGE`, `SQUASH` or `REBASE`):

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Merge me!
    uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@master
    with:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      MERGE_METHOD: MERGE
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See usage notes on how to
consume this package in your project.

### Prerequisites

Minimal requirements to set up the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v12, installation instructions can be found
  on the official website, a recommended installation option is to use
  [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#readme). It can be
  installed in a
  [few commands](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm).
- A package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). All instructions in the
  documentation will follow the npm syntax.
- Optionally a [Git](https://git-scm.com) client.

### Installing

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ridedott/merge-me-action.git
```

In case you don't have a git client, you can get the latest version directly by
using
[this link](https://github.com/ridedott/merge-me-action/archive/master.zip) and
extracting the downloaded archive.

Go the the right directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd merge-me-action
npm install
```

That's it! You can now go to the next step.

## Testing

All tests are being executed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io). All tests files
live side-to-side with a source code and have a common suffix: `.spec.ts`. Some
helper methods are being stored in the `test` directory.

There are three helper scripts to run tests in the most common scenarios:

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage
```

## Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to automate formatting. All
supported files are being reformatted in a pre-commit hook. You can also use one
of the two scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the files:

```bash
npm run format
npm run format:fix
```

## Linting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to enable static analysis.
TypeScript files are linted using a [custom configuration](./.eslintrc). You can
use one of the following scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the
files:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

## Publishing

Publishing is handled in an automated way and must not be performed manually.

Each commit to the master branch is automatically tagged using
[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
