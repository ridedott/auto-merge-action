## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See usage notes on how to
consume this package in your project.

<!-- Instructions -->

### Prerequisites

Minimal requirements to set up the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v12, installation instructions can be found
  on the official website, a recommended installation option is to use
  [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#readme). It can be
  installed in a
  [few commands](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm).
- A package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). All instructions in the
  documentation will follow the npm syntax.
- Optionally a [Git](https://git-scm.com) client.

### Installing

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ridedott/dependabot-auto-merge-action.git
```

In case you don't have a git client, you can get the latest version directly by
using
[this link](https://github.com/ridedott/dependabot-auto-merge-action/archive/master.zip)
and extracting the downloaded archive.

Go the the right directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd dependabot-auto-merge-action
npm install
```

That's it! You can now go to the next step.

## Tests

### Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to automate formatting. All
supported files are being reformatted in a pre-commit hook. You can also use one
of the two scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the files:

```bash
npm run format
npm run format:fix
```

### Linting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to enable static analysis.
TypeScript files are linted using a [custom configuration](./.eslintrc). You can
use one of the following scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the
files:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```
